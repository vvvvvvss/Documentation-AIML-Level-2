## Task 1 - Decision Tree based ID3 Algorithm
Used Decision trees based ID3 Algorthm to predict the win quality. 
Built ID3 algorthm from scratch. Calculated entropy, information gain, weighted average entropy of the dataset.

## Task 2: Naive Bayesian Classifier
Built a  Naive Bayesian Classifier that works on BBC's data and categorizers texts into entertainment, tech, business, sport, etc. 
The categorical data is converted into numerical data such that it can be interpreted by the machine. 
This is done by analyzing repeated words in each category. The categorical data is converted into numerical data.
